# Todo-App
A simple and interactive To-Do app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks, enhancing productivity and task management. Through this project, I applied core JavaScript skills, focusing on DOM manipulation to create a smooth user experience.
